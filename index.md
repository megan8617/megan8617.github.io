## About Me ##
I am an Earth scientist living in California and working at a national laboratory. Studying the reactivity of fluids in the subsurface has surprisingly kept me gainfully and mostly happily employed, working on topics like geological carbon storage, water-rock reaction kinetics, contaminant transport processes, geothermal energy operations, subsurface hydrogen storage and mining waste mineralization. I also recently earned my Master Gardener certification and am on a mission to reduce my water usage in and around my house, starting with killing my lawn.
